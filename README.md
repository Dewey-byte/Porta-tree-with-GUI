# Porta-tree with GUI

A graphical user interface (GUI) application for managing and visualizing a **Porta-tree data structure**.  
This project demonstrates how to implement a tree structure (commonly used for decision trees, menus, and hierarchical organization) with an interactive GUI, allowing users to interact with the data visually.

## 🧠 About

**Porta-tree with GUI** is a desktop application built to **visualize and interact with a Porta-tree (portmanteau of “portal” and “tree”) data structure**.  
The GUI enables adding, removing, and exploring nodes, making it easier to understand hierarchical relationships and how tree structures behave in real time.

This project is suitable for:
- Data structure learning and visualization
- GUI application development practice
- Educational demonstrations
- Small desktop utilities

---

## ✨ Features

- 📌 Interactive tree visualization  
- ➕ Add and remove tree nodes with GUI controls  
- 🔍 Explore tree hierarchy visually  
- 🔄 Dynamic updates and user feedback  
- 📘 Ideal for understanding tree data structures

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

The main technologies used in this project are:

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Tkinter** – Built-in Python GUI toolkit  
- **Object-oriented design** – For structuring tree and node classes

_(If your GUI uses another toolkit or language like Java, C#, or Electron, replace accordingly.)_

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧾 Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- **Python 3.7+** installed on your system

### 📦 Install Dependencies

If your project uses additional libraries, install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you’re only using Tkinter, no extra installation is needed (Tkinter comes bundled with most Python distributions).

▶️ Running the App
To launch the Porta-tree GUI:

Open a terminal in the project directory

Run:

python main.py
The tree GUI window should open, allowing you to interact with nodes and explore the structure.

📌 Usage

Once the app is running:

Add nodes via the UI controls

Delete nodes with selections or input

Explore tree structure visually

Observe dynamic updates when nodes change

Use this app to get hands-on experience with tree operations and GUI event handling.
